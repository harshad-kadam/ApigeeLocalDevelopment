### Benefits of Local Development for Apigee Development:
Local development, using the Apigee local development plugin, offers several advantages for your Apigee projects:

1. Speed and Efficiency:
Rapid iteration: Make changes, test, and iterate quickly without deploying to Apigee Edge, saving time and resources.
Offline development: Develop and test even without an internet connection, ideal for remote work or unreliable networks.
Faster debugging: Use breakpoints, logging, and the Apigee JavaScript Debugger for efficient local debugging within policies.

2. Improved Quality and Control:
- Early testing: Catch issues early through local testing before deploying to production, leading to higher quality APIs.
- Flexibility: Customize your local development environment to your needs, adding specific tools or settings.
- Control over infrastructure: Understand how your API interacts with different environments before deployment.

3. Other Benefits:
- Reduced costs: Potentially save on Apigee Edge deployment costs during development and testing phases.
- Better developer experience: More efficient development workflow can lead to improved developer satisfaction and productivity.
- Testing specific scenarios: Simulate diverse environments and network conditions locally for targeted testing.

4. Things to Consider:
- Local development does not fully replicate the production environment, so additional testing in Apigee Edge may be necessary.
- Complex dependencies or large API workloads might be better suited for development directly in Apigee Edge.
Overall, local development with the Apigee local development plugin can significantly enhance your Apigee development experience by boosting speed, improving quality, and offering greater control.


### Known Issues and Disadvantages of Apigee Local Development:

While Apiggee local development offers undeniable benefits, it's not without its limitations and potential drawbacks. Here are some key points to consider:

1. Limited Environment Replication:

* The local environment might not perfectly match the production Apigee Edge environment, especially regarding security configurations, network conditions, and resource limitations. This can lead to discrepancies in behavior and require additional testing in Apigee Edge to ensure smooth production deployment.
* Local development doesn't replicate complex runtime features like service callouts, external dependencies, or advanced security configurations available in Apigee Edge.

2. Scalability and Performance:

* Local development might not accurately reflect the performance or scalability of your API under heavier loads or large user bases. For performance-critical APIs, extensive testing in Apigee Edge is still crucial.
* Resource limitations on your local machine might hinder testing scenarios with high traffic or complex processing requirements.

3. Debugging and Troubleshooting:

* Local debugging and troubleshooting might not capture issues arising from interactions with other deployed APIs, security policies, or infrastructure aspects specific to Apigee Edge.
* Debugging complex issues involving multiple resources or distributed systems can be more challenging in a local environment.

4. Additional Considerations:

Limited team collaboration: Local development primarily benefits individual developers. Collaboration can be more challenging compared to working directly in the shared environment of Apigee Edge.
Version control and deployment complexity: Managing code versions and dependencies across local development and Apigee Edge environments can add complexity, requiring careful attention to version control practices and deployment processes.

5. Overall:

Although Apigee local development provides significant advantages for rapid development, testing, and debugging, it's essential to be aware of its limitations. Consider these potential drawbacks when deciding whether and how to integrate local development into your workflow. For production-critical APIs or scenarios involving complex interactions and scalability, comprehensive testing in Apigee Edge remains indispensable.
